# Data Processor
### DESCRIPTION
The two files to run this program are located here: 
[Data Processor](dataprocessor.py) and [Data File](data.csv)

A simple program in Python to take an input file using sysarg and correct errors in formatting. It will prompt the user to fix the mistakes if any, then adds these values into a dictionary. 

The example uses sample employee information. Given a last and first name, middle initial, employee id, and a phone number. They are formatted in a uniform way and if there's an error, then the user is prompted to fix it by inputting a new value. 

Finally, the information is put into a dictionary and turned into a .pickle file. The program reads the .pickle file back and displays the employee information so the user can confirm everything is correct. 

### HOW TO RUN
Download both the files and simply run the program with a parameter for the file location of the data.csv file

### STRENGTHS / WEAKNESSES OF PYTHON FOR TEXT PROCESSING
I would say that Python is incredibly useful for processing text and filtering until a desired outcome can be achieved. There is a lot of methods and versatility with strings as well. I am looking forward to seeing how far this can go, especially with Natural Language Processing. 

### WHAT I LEARNED
Since this was my first actual Python program I wrote, I learned quite a lot. Having been introduced to what Python is and how best to use it, I was looking forward to trying it out. This program helped me to realize the potential of Python when it comes to processing large amounts of data and formatting if needed.
